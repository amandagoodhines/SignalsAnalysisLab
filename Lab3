%% Objectives: Compare data collection factors such as sampling rate and range, quatitatively compare different leads from Einthovenâ€™s Triangle
%	Determine factors that affect ECG signal amplitude,	Compare different hardware and software options for collecting data, specifically ECG.

%%Equation to calculate signal-to-noise (SNR) of a signal (Manually)
%I would calculate the RMS amplitudes and use those in the above formula.
%Where P is power, and A is amplitude.
SNR = Psignal / Pnoise = (Asignal / Anoise)^2

%%Equation to calculate signal-to-noise (SNR) of a signal (function)
%Use this form when the input signal is not necessarily sinusoidal and you have an estimate of the noise.
%calculates the snr of signal x(dB) by computing the ratio of its summed squared magnitude to that of the noise, y. 
%y must have the same dimensions as x.

r = snr(x,y);
